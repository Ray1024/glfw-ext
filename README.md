# GLFW-ext

## Introduction

This is a extra library of glfw from http://www.glfw.org/ 
(Only for version 3.1.2 for now.).</br>
The extra feature is that you can create a glfw object and its associated context
 by with existing native handles. 
That solved many problems. Such as, render on a child window, render on a unknown
window but handle, etc.

## Compiling GLFW

See the [Compiling GLFW](http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/compile.html) guide in
